# 💫 About Me:

🔭 **I'm currently working on**

**ESG Risk Assessment Framework** at University of Birmingham, where I'm developing AI-powered monitoring systems for cross-regulatory compliance across SEBI and RBI guidelines. Building comprehensive ESG risk evaluation frameworks that integrate corporate responsibilities, financial obligations, and investment management duties.

**ML-Driven Financial Analytics** - Creating sentiment analysis models that achieve 87% correlation between media sentiment and UK banking sector liquidity patterns, combining NLP with financial modeling to quantify market dynamics.

👯 **I'm looking to collaborate on**

- **FinTech Projects:** Payment systems, trading algorithms, or risk management platforms
- **AI/ML in Finance:** Sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, or automated trading systems
- **ESG Tech Solutions:** Sustainability reporting tools, carbon footprint trackers, or ESG scoring systems
- **Open Source Financial Tools:** Data visualization libraries, financial modeling frameworks, or market analysis tools
- **Quantitative Research:** IPO performance analysis, market efficiency studies, or macroeconomic modeling

🤝 **I'm looking for help with**

- **Advanced Deep Learning:** Exploring transformer models and LLMs for financial document analysis
- **Real-time Trading Systems:** Building low-latency systems for algorithmic trading
- **Blockchain & DeFi:** Understanding decentralized finance protocols and smart contract development
- **Cloud Architecture:** Scaling financial applications on AWS/Azure for institutional-grade performance

🌱 **I'm currently learning**

- Advanced Natural Language Processing techniques for financial news analysis
- Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA, GARCH, and neural networks
- Cloud-native development with Docker, Kubernetes for scalable FinTech solutions
- Regulatory Technology (RegTech) frameworks for automated compliance monitoring
- Quantitative Finance - derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and risk management

💬 **Ask me about**

- **Investment Banking:** Valuation methods (DCF, Comparable Analysis), M&A structuring, pitch deck creation
- **Financial Modeling:** Building sophisticated Excel models, scenario analysis, sensitivity testing
- **Credit Risk Management:** Portfolio analysis, default prediction, regulatory compliance (Basel III)
- **Python for Finance:** Pandas, NumPy, Financial libraries, API integrations (Bloomberg, Eikon)
- **Database Optimization:** MySQL performance tuning, query optimization, data modeling
- **ESG Analytics:** BRSR reporting, climate risk integration, sustainable finance frameworks
- **Software Engineering:** Java Spring Boot, JDBC, RESTful APIs, microservices architecture

⚡ **Fun fact**

I switched from being a Mechanical Engineer to a Software Engineer at Cognizant, and then pivoted again into Investment Banking and Financial Analytics! 🚀

When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, you'll find me watching F1 races 🏎️ (massive fan of the strategy and data analytics behind it), tending to my garden 🌱, or volunteering in community service projects. I once led a COVID-19 awareness campaign that reached 500+ residents and educated 50 underprivileged children, raising £3,000 for school resources.
